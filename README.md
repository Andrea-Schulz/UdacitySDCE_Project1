* optional - [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil)

## Project Description

The SDC Engineer Nanodegree course contains 6 projects, with the questions of interest differing for each one: in **Object Detection in an Urban Environment**, a convolutional neural network is used to detect and classify objects using data from the [Waymo open dataset](https://waymo.com/open/download/).
